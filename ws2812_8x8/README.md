# ws2812_8x8
This demo showcases driving an 8x8 RGB LED array connected to GPIO22
It's a slightly modified version of the example from the Pico repo
https://github.com/rp-rs/rp-hal/blob/main/boards/rp-pico/examples/pico_ws2812_led.rs

This code should be compatible with any ws2812 panel - I used https://core-electronics.com.au/glowbit-matrix-8x8.html
